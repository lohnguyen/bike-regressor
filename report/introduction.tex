\subsection{Project Description:}

We plan to use the Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset form the UCI archive. 

In our project, we hope to develop a regression model which will allow us to accurately predict how many bikes should be available to be rented out given information about the weather and day. In order to do this, we will first figure out which attributes we will drop from the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset through set of preliminary data analysis. Then we will find and create the best regression model which accurately captures the data. Finally, we will create a website in which a user will be able to enter weather and date information in order to recieve the best prediction of how many bikes will have to be prepared for renting.
