\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

In the pursuit of building an accurate model, we did not encounter many problems due to
the fact that regression problems are fairly straightforward. Because of this, we were able to
experiment with many different algorithms and find out which would most accurately fit our
data. We found out that Random Forests was the most accurate and reliable for our purposes.
Because supervised learning algorithms were covered over the course of the class, we
were able to implement a lot of material from class into our project. Our project allowed us all to
understand the class material more in depth. We were able to use algorithms we learned in class
(Linear Regression and SVM) while also learning of new algorithms based on topics covered
during lectures (Random Forests and Gradient Boosting).

In future versions of the project, we would like to implement a feature where the user can
choose their locations and the Web Application fetches the required information and inputs it
into the model, then predicts it. We would also like to find a way to include the solar radiation
into our model predictions because we had to remove it due to inability to find real time values
of it.
