                    - Continuous: time of day, temperature, humidity, windspeed, visibility, rainfall, snowfall.
                    - Categorical: day of week, whether it is a holiday, season, and whether it is a business day.

                Here, we include 4 different models . 
                We recommend using Random Forests or Gradient Boosting as they are the most accurate and comparable to one another. 
                Support Vector Machine (SVM) is still accurate and trustworthy for a choice. 
                Linear Regression is not accurate, but if you are curious, feel free to compare the outcomes between this algorithm and the others.
